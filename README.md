# Cloudflare Workers Modules

Written by Blaine Harper, for Indian Hills CC IT Dept.

General modules that can be used for creating applications using Cloudflare Workers.  

To include a module in your Worker, copy the file or module contents into a new file within your Worker project in the same directory (or sub-directory) of your project.  

Include the modules by adding `import { rawHtmlResponse } from './cloudflareStd';` to include specific functions.  

### Contents

- Cloudflare Standard | ihccStd.js
